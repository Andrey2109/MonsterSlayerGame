Monster Slayer is a simple browser-based game built using Vue.js. The game allows the player to battle against a monster, using a variety of actions like attacking, special attacking, and healing. Itâ€™s a great introductory project for learning Vue.js and basic JavaScript game logic.

## Features
- Player vs Monster Battle: Battle against a monster, dealing and receiving damage.
- Special Attack: Execute a more powerful attack every few rounds.
- Healing: Heal yourself to recover lost health.
- Battle Log: Track each action taken by both the player and the monster.
- Responsive UI: A responsive interface built with Vue.js and CSS.

## How to Play
1. Attack the Monster: Use the "ATTACK" button to deal damage to the monster.
2. Special Attack: Every three rounds, you can use the "SPECIAL ATTACK" button to deal greater damage.
3. Heal Yourself: Use the "HEAL" button to restore some health points.
4. Surrender: Click "SURRENDER" to admit defeat if the monster is too strong.
5. Battle Log: Each action, whether a heal, attack, or special attack, is recorded in the battle log for you to review the battle history.

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js 3.4.9: The game is built using Vue.js to demonstrate component-based reactive front-end design.
- JavaScript: Core game logic is written in vanilla JavaScript.
- HTML & CSS: Markup and styling to create a responsive and visually appealing game layout
